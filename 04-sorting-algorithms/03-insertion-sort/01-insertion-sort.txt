INSERTION SORT

Builds up the sort by gradually creating a larger portion that is always sorted
- it takes each element and places it where it should go in the sorted portion



How it works

We start from left to right (from second element) and take every element and place it
on its proper place.


pseudocode:
- start by picking the second element in the array (first element is in sorted portion)
- compare the second element with the one before and swap if required
- compare every next element with the sorted portion and place it where required


Time complexity:

worst case: O(n**2)time

if data is almost sorted: O(n)time

- good use: if data is comming in streaming, quick insert
