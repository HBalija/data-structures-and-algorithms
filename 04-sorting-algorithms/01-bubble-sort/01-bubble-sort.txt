BUBBLE SORT

A sorting algorithm where the largest values bubble up to the top



How it works

- when we loop through each item, we compare it to the next item, and if
  it is bigger we swap their places
- then compare it to the next item
- if we don't swap, we move to the next item in array and compare
- after first iteration the largest number will be on top
- after second, second largest will be next to the largest ...
- if no swaps made in iteration, list is sorted



pseudocode:
- start looping from the end of the array towards the beginning (var i)
- start an inner loop from beginning untill i-1 (var j)
- if arr[j] is greater than arr[j+1], swap those two
- return sorted array



Time complexity: O(n**2) in general

but if the data is nearly sorted, we get O(n)time
