MERGE SORT:

introduced by John von Neumann in 1948.

- combination of 3 things: splitting, merging and sorting
- exploits the fact that arrays of 0 or 1 element are already sorted
- works by decomposing an array into smaller arrays of 0 or 1 elements, then building
  up a new sorted array
- uses divide and conquer approach


how it works:
- break up the array into halves until you have arrays that are empty or have one element
- once you have smaller sorted arrays, merge them with other sorted arrays until
  you are back at the full length of the array (recursion)


EFFICIENCY

Time (best)    Time (avg)    Time (worst)    Space
O(n log n)     O(n log n)    O(n log n)       O(n)
