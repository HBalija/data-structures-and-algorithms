SLIDING WINDOW


This pattern involves creating a window which can be an array or number
from one postion to another.
Depending on a certain condition, the window either increases or closes (and a new window is created).

Very useful for keeping track of a subset of data in an array/string, checking a sequence of chars...


Example:

Write a function called maxSubarraySum which accepts an array of integers and a
number called n. The function should calculate the maximum sum of n consecutive
elements in the array.

maxSubarraySum([1, 2, 5, 2, 8, 1, 5], 2) // 10
maxSubarraySum([1, 2, 5, 2, 8, 1, 5], 4) // 17
maxSubarraySum([4, 2, 1, 6], 1) // 6
maxSubarraySum([], 3) // null
