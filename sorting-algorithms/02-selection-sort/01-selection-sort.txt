Selection Sort

How it works?

We iterate over a list starting with first element and if element compared is smaller,
store its index. After first iteration swap the smallest element with the first one. Reiterate
from second element.


pseudocode:
- store the first element index as the smallest value so far
- compare this item to next item in array until you find a smaller number
- if a smaller number is found, designate that smaller number to be the new minimum
  and continue untill the end of array
- swap values if new min
- repeat the process with the next item


Time complexity:


O(n**2)time

- only better than bubble sort if swap() call is limited
