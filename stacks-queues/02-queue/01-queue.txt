QUEUE

- FIFO data structure (first in first out)


usage:
- background tasks (python celery for example)
- uploading resources
- printing / task processing



array / list implementation:

- push() and shift()
- unshift() and pop()

- both shift() and unshift() have O(n)time --> array not a good choice


Big O of queues

Insertion (push) - O(1)time
Removal (pop) - O(1)time
Searching - O(n)time
Access - O(n)time
