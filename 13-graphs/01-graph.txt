GRAPHS


Graph - collection of nodes and connections between these nodes
- tree has parent nodes (graphs don't)

USAGE:
- social networks
- location / mapping
- routing algorithms
- visual hierarchy
- file system optimizations
- EVERYWHERE!

GRAPH TERMS:

- Vertex - a node
- Edge - connection between the nodes
- Weighted / Unweighted - values assigned to distances between vertices
- Directed / Undirected - directions assigned to distances between vertices

Directed vs Undirected
- directed is more "one - way relationship"
- directed is often represented with arrows which indicates connection (polarity of edge)


RELATIONSHIPS BETWEEN VERTICES

ADJECENCY MATRIX
- matrix is a two dimensional structure usually implemented with nested arrays
+ can take up less space (in sparse graphs)
+ faster to iterate over all edges
- can be slower to lookup specific edge

ADJECENCY LIST
  - we use array to store the edges
  - or if we have numeric nodes or similar, we can use a hash table (dict, object, map)
- takes up more space (in sparse graphs)
- slower to iterate over all edges
+ faster to lookup specific edge
