PRIORITY QUEUES

A data structure where each element has a priority. Elements with higher priorities
are served before elements with lower priorities.

A collection of data where each element has a priority associated with it.

We take one thing at a time out of it - depending on its priority.

Binary heap is a good way to implement it.
We can use an array for implementation - but for each operation we have O(n)time.

pseudocode:
- write a min binary heap - lower number means higher priority
- each node has a value and a priority; use the priority to build the heap
- "enqueue" method accepts value and priority, makes a new node, and puts
  it in the right spot based off its priority
- "dequeue" method removes root element, returns it, and rearranges heap using priority
